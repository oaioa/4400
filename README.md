**It is my first Haskell project.**

The objective of this project is to make a chat server that respect a certain protocol.

I really struggled to understand how Haskell worked and to find an easy tutorial. 
My code is based on https://wiki.haskell.org/Implement_a_chat_server
I did not find yet how to implement different chatrooms.
