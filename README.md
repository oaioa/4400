# 4400

A repository that contains some school projects.  
The main objective is to understand the challenges of distributed systems development. 

For me one other objective is to learn my first pure functionnal language

#### basicChatServerHaskell
"a chat server that implements a given protocol"

#### use-cloudhaskell
"a REST service system, focussed on the efficient computation of code complexity for a given repository, utilising a set of nodes as appropriate to minimise execution time from submission to result return."
