# 4400

The objective of this project is to make a chat server that respect a certain protocol.

**It is my first Haskell project.**

I really struggled to understand how Haskell worked and to find an easy tutorial. 
My code is based on https://wiki.haskell.org/Implement_a_chat_server

I am stuck since a long time at 13 at the test for chat server. 
The error is  *"Server response is empty: Connection rest by peer"*
